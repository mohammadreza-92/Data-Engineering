## Explanation of the DAG Workflow

This Apache Airflow DAG defines a complex ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipeline that automates the process of extracting data from an API, transforming it using Pandas, and loading it into a PostgreSQL database. Additionally, it includes error handling, retries, notifications, and task grouping for better organization.

1. DAG Configuration

DAG Default Arguments

The DAG is configured with:
	•	Owner: "airflow" → Specifies the DAG owner.
	•	depends_on_past: False → Tasks don’t depend on past runs.
	•	start_date: days_ago(1) → Starts execution from one day ago.
	•	retries: 3 → If a task fails, it will retry up to 3 times.

2. DAG Structure

The DAG runs daily (schedule_interval='@daily') and consists of four main tasks:

	  1.Extract Data (extract)
	    •	Fetches raw data from an API endpoint.
	    •	If the request is successful (status_code 200), the data is returned as JSON.
	    •	If the request fails, an exception is raised.
	  2. Transform Data (transform)
	    •	Converts raw data into a Pandas DataFrame.
	    •	Adds a timestamp column (processed_at).
	    •	Cleans the data by removing any missing values.
	    •	Applies a business rule transformation (value * 1.2 to scale the data).
	    •	Converts transformed data back into a dictionary and stores it using Airflow’s XCom (so the next task can access it).
	  3. Load Data (load)
  	  •	Retrieves transformed data from XCom.
	    •	Connects to a PostgreSQL database.
	    •	Iterates over transformed records and inserts them into a table.
	    •	Commits the transaction and closes the database connection.
    4. Notification (notify)
	    •	Sends an email alert upon DAG execution.
	    •	Uses SMTP (email server) to send a message about DAG completion.
	    •	Logs an error if email sending fails.

3. Task Dependencies

Task Grouping (ETL Group)
	•	The ETL steps (extract, transform, load) are grouped together using TaskGroup("etl_group"), which makes it visually easier to manage.

Execution Flow
	•	Extract Data → Transform Data → Load Data → Send Notification
	•	The notify task only runs after the ETL group has successfully completed.

4. Error Handling & Features
	•	Retries: If any task fails, it retries up to 3 times.
	•	Parallelism: Using TaskGroup allows batch processing and better resource allocation.
	•	Data Persistence: Uses XCom to share data between tasks.
	•	Notifications: Alerts the team if something goes wrong.

Summary: How It Works
	1.	Airflow triggers the DAG every day.
	2.	extract fetches data from an API.
	3.	transform processes and cleans the data.
	4.	load inserts transformed data into PostgreSQL.
	5.	notify sends an email confirming success.
	6.	The DAG completes execution and waits for the next scheduled run.
