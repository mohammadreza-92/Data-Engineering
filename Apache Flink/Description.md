# Key Points About the Codes:

Different State Types:

ListState for storing multiple values (e.g., sensor readings)
ValueState for storing single values (e.g., last user activity)
MapState for key-value storage

Time Management:
Using timers for detecting expired sessions
Processing based on event time

Fault Tolerance:
All states are automatically managed by Flink's checkpointing mechanism
Data Sources:
Examples use Kafka as data source

Can be replaced with other sources like files or sockets
